This package implements the Nosé-Hoover mesh thermostat in LAMMPS.
See [TODO: REF DETAILS] for details.
The package provides the following features:

* applying a linear combination of Nosé-Hoover thermostats to a given particle
* applying thermostats to particles and/or other thermostats simultaneously
* partitioning of particles based on their location relative to some point
* balancing of partition matrix to conserve dof per thermostat

[TODO:] See the file doc/nhmesh_tutorial.html for getting started.

[TODO MAYBE:] There are auxiliary tools for using this package in tools/nhmesh.

[TODO:] There are example scripts for using this package in examples/USER/nhmesh.

The person who created this package is Stephen Sanderson at the
Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, The University of
Queensland, Australia (stephen.sanderson at uq.edu.au). Contact him directly if
you have questions.
